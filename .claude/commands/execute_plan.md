$ARGUMENTS

Review this plan for development of this feature. We are going to complete one task at a time, so choose one to focus on. Ensure every task is well tested where it makes sense, only marking a task complete once we've run all appropriate tests.
Before starting coding, review if there are any clarifications you need me to make. We must make sure there are answers to open questions before proceeding. Give recommendations for each question.
